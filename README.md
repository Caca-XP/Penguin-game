## Try the game:

https://caca-xp.github.io/Penguin-game/

## How to Use
The game will wait for an action to start.

Once the game starts, the penguin will slide off the ice platform.

Once the penguin is inside the water, it can start doing actions:

- `Arrow-up` or `space` or `w-key` to jump
- `Arrow-down` or `s-key` to dive

The longer the key is pressed, the higher/lower the height the penguin moves.

Th objective of the game is to get the highest score possible without clashing against obstacles.

## Motivations
This webgame was developed to make our own rendition to the google dino game but with yellow eyed penguin which is endemic to New Zealand.
